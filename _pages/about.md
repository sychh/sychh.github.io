Hi, this is Siying Hu ~~ 
I received my PhD degree in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Zhicong Lu. 


Research Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Collaboration, Human-centred AI and Responsible AI. My work has been published in CHI, CSCW, FAcct, IJHCI and EMNLP. My work marks a milestone, being the first paper accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) with a corresponding author from a Chinese research institution in Asia. Please check my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BJg8enwAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) for more details.

Seasons change. Life persists. 
Academia is a chapter, not the whole story.

I'm currently in the Greater Bay Area, serving as a referee and coach for table tennis tournaments. Hoping to become an international referee in the future. 业余爱好噶点网文而已~~~
