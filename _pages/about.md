Hi, this is Siying Hu (Chinese: 胡思颖) ~~~ 
I received my PhD degree in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Professor [Zhicong Lu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~luzhc/).


Research Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Collaboration, Human-centred AI and Responsible AI. My work has been published in CHI, CSCW, FAcct, and IJHCI. My work marks a milestone, being the first paper accepted at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) with a corresponding author from a Chinese research institution in Asia. Please check my [publications](https://sychh.github.io/publications/) for more details.

I'm currently in the Greater Bay Area, serving as a referee and coach for table tennis tournaments. Hoping to become an international referee in the future.
